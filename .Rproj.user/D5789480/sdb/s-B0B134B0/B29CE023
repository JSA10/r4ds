One day you will be working on multiple analyses\nsimultaneously that all use R and you want to keep them separate. One day you\nwill need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results\nand figures from R back out into the world. To handle these real life\nsituations, you need to make two decisions:\n\n1. What about your analysis is “real”, i.e. what will you save as your lasting\nrecord of what happened?\n\n2. Where does your analysis “live”?\n\n\nAs a beginning R user, it’s OK to consider your environment (i.e. the objects\nlisted in the environment pane) “real”. However, in the long run, you’ll be much\nbetter off if you consider your R scripts as “real”.\n\nThere is a great pair of keyboard shortcuts that will work together to make\nsure you’ve captured the important parts of your code in the editor:\n\nPress Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F10 to restart RStudio.\nPress Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S to rerun the current script.\n\nI use this pattern hundreds of times a week.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\"\"\"\n8.4 RStudio projects\n\nR experts keep all the files associated with a project together — input data,\nR scripts, analytical results, figures. This is such a wise and common practice\nthat RStudio has built-in support for this via projects.\n\"\"\"\n\n## created new r4ds project in DataScience folder\n\ngetwd()\n#[1] \"/Users/jeromeahye/Documents/DataScience/r4ds\"\n\n\"\"\"\nNow enter the following commands in the script editor, and save the file,\ncalling it “diamonds.R”. Next, run the complete script which will save a PDF\nand CSV file into your project directory. Don’t worry about the details, you’ll\nlearn them later in the book.\n\"\"\"\n\n#below saved in diamonds.r file with r4ds project folder\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +\n    geom_hex()\nggsave(\"diamonds.pdf\")\n\nwrite_csv(diamonds, \"diamonds.csv\")\n\n#this next part is important\n\n\"\"\"\nQuit RStudio. Inspect the folder associated with your project — notice the\n.Rproj file. Double-click that file to re-open the project. Notice you get back\nto where you left off: it’s the same working directory and command history, and\nall the files you were working on are still open. Because you followed my\ninstructions above, you will, however, have a completely fresh environment,\nguaranteeing that you’re starting with a clean slate.\n\nIn your favorite OS-specific way, search your computer for diamonds.pdf and\nyou will find the PDF (no surprise) but also the script that created it\n(diamonds.r). This is huge win! One day you will want to remake a figure or\njust understand where it came from.\n\n*** If you rigorously save figures to files with R code and never with the mouse\nor the clipboard, you will be able to reproduce old work with ease! ***\n\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"\n8.5 Summary\n\nIn summary, RStudio projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future:\n\nCreate an RStudio project for each data analyis project.\n\nKeep data files there; we’ll talk about loading them into R in data import.\n\nKeep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.\n\nSave your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.\n\nOnly ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.\n\nEverything you need is in one place, and cleanly separated from all the other\nprojects that you are working on.\n\"\"\"\n\n",
